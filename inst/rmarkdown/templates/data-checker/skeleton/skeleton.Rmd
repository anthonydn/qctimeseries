## 0 Installation and load package

```{r setup}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("anthonydn/qctimeseries", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(qctimeseries)
```

## 0.1 Instruction manual here:

```{r instructions}
vignette("overall_workflow", package = "qctimeseries")
```

## 1  Load data (run once per session - HIT PLAY BUTTON AT RIGHT TO RUN CODE "CHUNK")

If you import your own data and add qc_flags (see vignette above) and save it as .Rdata, it can be imported here if it is in the same folder as this template. Tip: find and replace "ibutton_example" with your data set name.

```{r import, message=FALSE}
load("ibutton_example_qc.RData")
```

## 2  Assess data checking progress

The table shows percent checked for every variable. Choose any variable that is less than 100%, then run the next chunk. If hide_complete = TRUE it will only show ones you have not completed.

```{r progress}
qc_progress(ibutton_example_qc, hide_complete = FALSE)
```

## 3  Check each variable
Change `y_col` below to the variable you are about to check, then run the chunk. The QC window opens in a browser tab. You can select variable names from the progress table above and paste them here.

```{r qc_window_app, warning=FALSE}
ibutton_example_qc <- qc_window_app(ibutton_example_qc, 
  time_col = "datetime", win_hrs = 10000,
  y_col = "temp") # <-- CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAME IN THE QUOTES
```

## 4  Save progress
Run before quitting RStudio. It is also recommended to run after each cleaned variable to avoid losing progress.

```{r save}
save(ibutton_example_qc, file = "ibutton_example_qc.RData")
```


## 5  Overview plot of the cleaned series

The unaltered data will appear on top with the qcflag codes and the final cleaned data on the bottom.

```{r check_plot, warning=FALSE}
qc_check_plot(ibutton_example_qc, y_col = "temp", time_col = "datetime")
```
